# Advent of Code 

This repository contains my personal solutions to the Advent of Code programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl. Advent of Code is an annual Advent-style challenge featuring small, standalone programming problems that can be solved in any language. I'm using this repo to practice problem-solving, improve my C++ skills, and experiment with different techniques throughout the event.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code provides daily puzzles throughout the first twelve days of December, suitable for all skill levels. Many people use the challenges for learning, interview preparation, university coursework, or just for fun.

## About This Repository

* Each day has its own folder (`Day01`, `Day02`, …) with a dedicated CMake target.
* Solutions are written in **C++20**.
* Inputs from the AoC website (not included publicly) should be placed in each day's directory.
